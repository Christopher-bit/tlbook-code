# Code for Transfer Learning on Computer Vision

## Object Detection

Go to `detection` folder. Then:

- For training without pre-trained models: `python main_detection.py --no-pretrain`
- For training with pre-trained models: `python main_detection.py`

## Neural Style Transfer

Go to `style_transfer` folder. Then:

- For training without pre-trained models: `python main_style.py --no-pretrain`
- For training with pre-trained models: `python main_style.py`
